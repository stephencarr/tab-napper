## [Unreleased]

### Added - Auto-Cleanup System
- **üßπ Automatic Inbox Cleanup**: Items older than 1 week moved to trash
  - Runs automatically on app startup
  - Prevents inbox from becoming cluttered
  - Timestamp-based aging (uses `timestamp` or `lastAccessed`)

- **üóëÔ∏è Automatic Trash Cleanup**: Items older than 1 month permanently deleted
  - Trash items older than 30 days are removed
  - Uses `trashedAt` timestamp for accurate tracking
  - Keeps trash manageable and performant

  - Shows preview before execution
  - Returns cleanup statistics

### Impact
- Automatic maintenance keeps app performant
- No user action required - runs on startup
- Configurable time periods (1 week inbox, 1 month trash)
- Non-blocking - won't prevent app from loading if cleanup fails

## [0.7.1] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed - Performance: Eliminated CPU Spike on Extension Load
- **‚ö° Staggered Component Loading**: Reduced concurrent Chrome API calls
  - SmartSuggestions delay increased from 1s to 3s to prioritize critical components
  - RecentlyVisited delay increased from 800ms to 1.5s to avoid API call overlap
  - Prevents simultaneous heavy operations that caused browser freezing
  
- **üìâ Optimized Data Fetching**: Reduced unnecessary data processing
  - SmartSuggestions history fetch reduced from 300 to 200 items (-33%)
  - SmartSuggestions URL processing limit reduced from 100 to 50 URLs (-50%)
  - RecentlyVisited fetch budget reduced from 5x to 3x multiplier (-40%)
  - History fetch timeout reduced from 5s to 3s for faster failure detection
  
- **üîÑ Batched Background Processing**: Non-blocking tab tracking
  - Background script now processes tabs in batches of 20 with 100ms delays
  - Spreads tab tracking load over ~500ms instead of blocking startup
  - Prevents CPU spike when extension loads with many open tabs

### Impact
- Eliminated 2-3 second CPU spike that caused browser UI freeze
- Extension now loads progressively with smooth, gradual CPU usage
- No functionality removed - all features work as before
- Maintains feature parity while significantly improving performance
